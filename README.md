# AiForge: The hacker's toolbox for rapid AI development üîß

## Inspiration üí°

As developers diving into AI, we kept hitting the same wall - managing prompts and model versions was a mess. We'd lose track of working prompts, couldn't easily share them with teammates, and spent too much time recreating what we'd already built. Drawing inspiration from Git's version control and MongoDB's pipeline capabilities, we decided to build a tool that would let developers focus on building cool AI features rather than managing them.

## What it does ‚ö°

AiForge is a developer-first platform that brings version control to AI development. It helps you:

- Version and track AI prompts like you version code
- Test prompts visually and compare results
- Share working prompts with your team
- Monitor performance and costs across different AI providers
- Roll back to previous versions when things break

## How we built it üõ†Ô∏è

We leveraged some powerful open-source tools:

- MLflow for experiment tracking and model management
- MongoDB Atlas for version control and pipeline management
- Databricks Mosaic AI for advanced prompt optimization
- LanceDB for efficient vector storage and retrieval
- React + TypeScript for the frontend
- Node.js for the backend API

The integration with Databricks' ecosystem, particularly MLflow and Mosaic AI, helps us provide robust version control and experiment tracking capabilities that developers need for rapid AI development.

## Challenges we ran into üöß

- Implementing Git-like version control for prompts was trickier than expected
- Building an efficient pipeline system with MongoDB Atlas required deep diving into their aggregation framework
- Balancing simplicity with power - keeping the interface clean while offering advanced features
- Integrating multiple AI providers while maintaining consistent version control
- Managing real-time collaboration without compromising performance

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÜ

- Built a clean, intuitive interface that developers actually want to use
- Successfully implemented version control for AI prompts
- Created an efficient pipeline system using MongoDB Atlas
- Integrated seamlessly with Databricks' MLflow for experiment tracking
- Made AI development more accessible to hackers and builders

## What we learned üìö

- Deep insights into MongoDB Atlas's pipeline capabilities
- How to effectively integrate Databricks' open-source tools
- The complexities of version control for AI development
- Real-world challenges in prompt engineering
- The importance of developer experience in AI tools

## What's next for AiForge üöÄ

- Enhanced integration with Databricks' ecosystem
- Advanced prompt optimization using Mosaic AI
- Collaborative features for team development
- Support for more AI providers
- Community features to share and discover prompts
- Integration with popular IDE extensions
